# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Wykiyanos

Live site: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/

This repo hosts my public portfolio site. It contains four assignment artifacts with “Coming Soon” placeholders:

1. TryHackMe Journal — Coming Soon  → `tryhackme.html`
2. Incident Handler’s Journal — Coming Soon → `incident.html`
3. Vulnerable System Analysis — Coming Soon → `vuln.html`
4. SQL Query — Coming Soon → `sql.html`

As I complete each lab, I’ll add notes, screenshots, and links to detailed repos.
