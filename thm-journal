# TryHackMe Journal — Progress Notes

## Project Introduction
I track hands-on rooms, flags, and lessons learned to build repeatable investigation habits.

## Modeling and Evaluation
- Methods: enumeration → exploitation → reporting
- Tools: Nmap, Gobuster, Hydra, Burp, Wireshark
- Evaluation: verify flags; map findings to MITRE ATT&CK

## Conclusion
Consistent note-taking improves triage speed.
**Next steps:** add 3 room write-ups with screenshots.

## Artifacts
